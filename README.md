# PublicToiletDataFetcher

## How we get data

Most data is obtained through one of 3 methods
- A) Scraping data from council websites
- B) Spreadsheets / csv file datasets sent in by local authorities and community groups
- C) Data extracted from the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap dataset (see Data/query.xml for the query used)

## Processing

- Data should be processed to end up in the following format, so that it can be uploaded to the toilets4london API

```json
  {
    "data_source": "Extracted from [URL] on [DATE]/ Data sent in by [COUNCIL] on [DATE]",
    "borough": "[See Data/boroughs.txt for acceptable borough names]",
    "address": "2-6 Woodgrange Road London E7 0QH",
    "opening_hours": "7am-6pm Monday to Friday",
    "name": "The Gate Community Neighbourhood Centre and Library",
    "baby_change": true,
    "latitude": 51.5485568,
    "longitude": 0.024924,
    "wheelchair": true,
    "covid": "Some text confirming how the toilet is affected by covid restrictions / lockdown (if needed)",
    "fee": "20p",
    "open": true
  }
```

- If the toilet is currently closed but may be open in the future, the `open` field can be set to `false`
- If fee is left out, it defaults to a free toilet
- `borough`, `latitude` and `longitude` are required fields
