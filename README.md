# PublicToiletDataFetcher

DataFetcher uses the xml queries in query.xml and broader_query.xml to query the OpenStreetMap API for data on toilets in London.
The Data/ directory also contains a csv file of public toilets in Camden from [https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/People-Places/Public-toilets/v8f3-kxqp].
